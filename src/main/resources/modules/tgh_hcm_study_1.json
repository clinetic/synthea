  "remarks": [
    "This module was last updated in 2020 based on the existing Synthea congestive_heartfailure_module. ",
    "The goal of the module is to simulate the life cycle of heart failure (HF) from onset to death, including hospitalizations for acute decompensations and procedural/interventions. ",
    "",
    "The module includes the following representations: ",
    "- HF ACC/AHA Stages C & D",
    "- NYHA Functional Classification I, II, III, and IV ",
    "- HF definitions of HF reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), HF midrange/borderline EF (HFmEF), and HF preserved EF (HFpEF), defined as an EF of <=40, 41-49, and >=50 respectively. For treatment and disease progression purposes, HFrEF is divided into subcategories of EF <20, EF 20-35, and EF 36-40. ",
    "- Goal directed medical therapy with diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, ARNIs, beta-blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor agonists (MRA), hydralazine-isosorbide, ivabradine, and digoxin, with treatment based on EF and evidence for use in the NYHA class. ",
    "- Non-pharmacological interventions for HF management (e.g., exercise, sodium restriction, smoking cessation etc.)",
    "- Procedural interventions based on clinical indications: ICD, CRT, LVAD, CABG, PCI, transplant",
    "",
    "This following model assumptions apply: ",
    "",
    "Prevalence: HF prevalence is informed by the Heart disease and stroke statistics—2020 update: a report from the American Heart Association. https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000000757 , Circulation 2020;141:e139–e596 ",
    "",
    "Pharmacotherapy: A single drug is used to represent a pharmacologic category (e.g., lisinopril for ACE inhibitors). The medication dose represented in the module is inclusive of all medication dosages, including titration to the maximum dose based on HF treatment recommendations. Although hydralazine-isosorbide has been recommended for individuals who identify as African American, we did not make this distinction in the module in light of recent discussions regarding the use of race—a  sociological construct—to  guide medication therapy, as well as clinical observations/discussions with frontline physicians noting that this medication is used across races. Additionally, the module at present does not reflect the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors (i.e., dapagliflozin) for patients with HFrEF and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM); however, individuals with Type 2 DM and HFrEF may receive an SGLT-2 as part of the metabolic disease module in Synthea. Medication utilization represented in the module is reflective of undertreatment and medication adherence observed in clinical practice. ",
    "",
    "Clinical Population Exclusions: The module care pathway excludes pregnant individuals and individuals <18 years of age. While treatment options for HF therapy during pregnancy are similar to non-pregnant individuals, certain treatments are avoided due to risk of teratogenicity and/or certain treatment considerations are made to prevent the risk of poor fetal outcomes. Individuals <18 patients were excluded considering the impact of congenital heart disease on disease prevalence and treatment options. ",
